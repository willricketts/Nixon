Nixon
=====

Nixon is a simple Arduino robot that I've been building over the last few months. It utilizes an Arduino Mega board, tank tread chassis, differential gearbox, and a Ping))) Ultrasonic rangefinder.

I named the project "Nixon" after Lewis Nixon, the father of modern sonar. I'll be updating this README as the project progresses.
